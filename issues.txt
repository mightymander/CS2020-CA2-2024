inside, initComponents() i was redeclaring incomeFields which was messing up with other things, this too a while to find

"JTextField[] incomeFields = new JTextField[numberIncomeRows];"

incomeFields = new JTextField[numberIncomeRows];

================

removing the need for a calulate button was very simple using DocumentListener

insertUpdate(DocumentEvent e): This method is called when text is inserted into the document.
removeUpdate(DocumentEvent e): This method is called when text is removed from the document.
changedUpdate(DocumentEvent e): This method is called when the document's attributes change.
